# APE Documentation

Welcome to **APE (Agentic Protocol Executor)** â€“ an open-source playground for building tool-using chat agents with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## High-level architecture

The live diagram in the repo-root `README.md` shows component relationships.

* **CLI shell** â€“ curses-free text UI, minimal logic.
* **ChatAgent** â€“ autonomous reasoning, tool routing, HMAC verification.
* **MCP server** â€“ stateless JSON-RPC process exposing database/search/â€¦ tools.
* **Plugin registry** â€“ `@tool` decorator + Python entry-points.
* **SQLite** â€“ simple persistence for conversation history.
* **Ollama** â€“ local LLM backend.
