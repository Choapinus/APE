# Project Build & Review: Multimodal Streaming Agent

This document provides a complete guide and review of the project, including the architecture, key learnings, and a roadmap for future improvements.

---

### **1. Project Status & Architecture**

The project is a **fully functional, multimodal agent** served via a FastAPI backend. It successfully processes both text and image inputs, communicates with a local Ollama instance running `gemma3:4b`, and provides both synchronous and reliable streaming responses.

The architecture is clean and modular:
- `main.py`: Entry point for the Uvicorn server.
- `ape/api.py`: Manages all API routes.
- `ape/llm.py`: Contains the core logic for interacting with the LLM.
- `ape/session.py`: A simple in-memory session manager.
- `ape/config.py`: Manages configuration from environment variables.
- `cli.py`: A command-line client for easy testing.

### **2. Key Advantages (What We've Done Well)**

1.  **Robust, Reliable Streaming:** The decision to bypass the library wrapper and implement streaming directly with `httpx` was the key to success. This is stable, efficient, and easy to debug.
2.  **Excellent Modularity:** The code is well-organized, making it easy to maintain and extend.
3.  **True Multimodality:** The agent correctly handles both text and image data.
4.  **Great Developer Experience:** Clear logging, a dedicated CLI, and FastAPI's auto-reloading make development efficient.
5.  **Flexible Configuration:** Settings are managed externally via `ape/config.py`.

### **3. Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement**

1.  **Stateless Conversations:** The agent's biggest weakness. It does not use past conversation turns, so it cannot answer follow-up questions.
2.  **Ephemeral History:** Session history is stored in-memory and is lost on every server restart.
3.  **Inconsistent LLM Logic:** The agent uses LlamaIndex for non-streaming calls but `httpx` for streaming. This should be unified.
4.  **Limited Test Coverage:** Critical streaming and session logic is not yet covered by automated tests.

### **4. Roadmap & Prioritized Next Steps**

1.  **Implement Conversational Context (High Priority):**
    -   **Task:** Modify `llm_stream_complete` to retrieve the session history and include it in the `messages` payload sent to Ollama. This will give the agent memory and enable true conversation.

2.  **Unify LLM Interaction Logic:**
    -   **Task:** Refactor the synchronous `llm_complete` function to also use the direct `httpx` method. This will remove an unnecessary dependency and make the codebase more consistent.

3.  **Make Session History Persistent:**
    -   **Task:** Replace the in-memory dictionary in `SessionManager` with a simple file-based database like Python's built-in `sqlite3`.

4.  **Improve Documentation and Testing:**
    -   **Task:** Update the `README.md` with detailed `curl` examples and add `pytest` cases for the streaming and session logic.

### **5. Original Build Log & Key Learnings**

- **Initial LlamaIndex Streaming Issue:** The `llm.stream_complete()` generator from LlamaIndex **failed to yield any data** when used within the FastAPI/Uvicorn runtime. This is a critical issue likely related to async event loops or threading context.
- **The Solution:** The breakthrough was to **bypass the LlamaIndex streaming wrapper entirely** and communicate directly with the Ollama `/api/chat` endpoint using `httpx`. This proved to be a more robust and reliable solution.
- **Lesson Learned:** Don't be afraid to bypass a library's abstraction layer if it's causing difficult-to-debug issues. Direct API calls are often more stable and transparent.

**Summary:**
Build a Python agent that exposes an MCP-compatible API, uses LlamaIndex with the Ollama backend (Gemma3:4b model), and supports multimodal (text + image) interactions. Follow best practices for modularity, configuration, and documentation. Reference the official LlamaIndex Ollama guide for LLM integration and multimodal support.
